# Cash Health Module — Documentation

> **Module**: `app/Http/Controllers/CashHealthController.php`
> **Views**: `resources/views/cash-health/`
> **Routes**: `routes/web.php` (lines 248–289)

## 1. Overview

The **Cash Health** module provides a cash-position dashboard for the lending institution. It pulls financial data from an external backend API (`https://lms2backend.whencefinancesystem.com`) and presents it at four hierarchical levels: **Branch → District → Province → National**.

Each level displays:
- A **Cash Health Score** (0–100) with three component sub-scores
- **Financial figures** (disbursements, collections, residual cash, operating costs, etc.)
- A **cycle selector** for the monthly cash cycle (25th → 24th)
- In the National view: an **interactive contribution history chart** and **live cash balances**

---

## 2. Controller — `CashHealthController.php`

### 2.1 Architecture

| Concern | Detail |
|---|---|
| Namespace | `App\Http\Controllers` |
| Dependencies | `Illuminate\Http\Request`, `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http`, `Carbon\Carbon`, `App\Models\Office` |
| API Base URL | `https://lms2backend.whencefinancesystem.com` |
| Default timeouts | 120s (show/national), 60s (district/province/contribution), 15s (province API call) |

### 2.2 Cash Cycle Logic

All methods share an identical cycle calculation:

```
If today >= 25:
  cycle_start = month's 25th
Else:
  cycle_start = previous month's 25th
cycle_end = cycle_start + 1 month - 1 day
```

**Example**: On Aug 20, the current cycle is **Jul 25 → Aug 24**. On Aug 26, it's **Aug 25 → Sep 24**.

A dropdown of 12 available cycles (current + previous 11) is generated and passed to the view.

---

### 2.3 `show(Request $request, $id)` — Branch Cash Health

**Route**: `GET /cash_health/show/{id}` → `cash_health.show`

**Purpose**: Displays a single branch office's complete cash health dashboard.

**Flow**:
1. Looks up office name from the `offices` table via `Office::where('id', $id)->value('name')`.
2. Calculates the current cash cycle start date.
3. Reads `cycle_start` from query params (falls back to current cycle).
4. Validates the date format; aborts 400 if invalid.
5. Validates the day is the 25th; aborts 400 otherwise.
6. Calculates cycle end = cycle_start + 1 month - 1 day.
7. Calls external API: `GET https://lms2backend.whencefinancesystem.com/cash-health/{id}?cycle_start=...`
8. Aborts with the API's status code if the request fails.
9. Generates 12 available cycles for the dropdown.
10. Returns view `cash-health.show` with:
    - `$cashHealth` — full API response
    - `$cycleStart` — selected cycle start
    - `$cycleEnd` — calculated cycle end
    - `$availableCycles` — 12-cycle options
    - `$id` — office ID
    - `$officeName` — office name

**Data structure expected from API**:
```php
$cashHealth['office']       // Office details
$cashHealth['cycle']        // Cycle metadata
$cashHealth['scores']       // overall, disbursement, collection, residual_cash, months_of_cover, full_payment_ratio, status
$cashHealth['financials']   // minimum_loan_target, residual_cash, defaults, net_cash_position, expected_cash_requirement, etc.
$cashHealth['loans']        // Loan-level data
$cashHealth['reason']       // Human-readable score explanation
$cashHealth['disbursed']    // Total amount disbursed
$cashHealth['collected']    // Total amount collected
```

---

### 2.4 `contributionHistory($id)` — AJAX Contribution Data

**Route**: `GET /cash_health/contribution/{id}` → `cash_health.contribution`

**Purpose**: Returns JSON data for the contribution history chart.

**Flow**:
1. Calls external API: `GET https://lms2backend.whencefinancesystem.com/cash-health/{id}/contributions/`
2. On API failure: logs the error and returns `{error, status}` JSON.
3. On exception: logs the error and returns `{error, message}` JSON with 500.
4. On success: returns `$response->json()` directly.

---

### 2.5 `district(Request $request, $district)` — District Cash Health

**Route**: `GET /cash_health/district/{district}` → `cash_health.district`

**Purpose**: Shows aggregate data for all offices within a district.

**Flow** (mirrors `show()`):
1. Gets all offices, keyed by ID: `Office::get()->keyBy('id')`.
2. Calculates current cash cycle.
3. Reads/selects `cycle_start` from query params.
4. Validates date format and 25th-day rule.
5. Calculates cycle end.
6. Calls external API: `GET https://lms2backend.whencefinancesystem.com/cash-health/district/{district}?cycle_start=...`
7. Returns view `cash-health.district` with:
    - `$districtHealth` — full API response (includes `district_name`, `district_id`, `scores`, `financials`, `reason`, `offices`)
    - `$cycleStart`, `$cycleEnd`, `$availableCycles`, `$offices`

---

### 2.6 `province(Request $request, $province)` — Provincial Cash Health

**Route**: `GET /cash_health/province/{province}` → `cash_health.province`

**Purpose**: Shows aggregate data for all districts within a province.

**Flow** (mirrors `show()` and `district()`):
1. Gets all offices, keyed by ID: `Office::get()->keyBy('id')`.
2. Calculates current cash cycle.
3. Reads/selects `cycle_start` from query params.
4. Validates date format and 25th-day rule.
5. Calculates cycle end.
6. Calls external API: `GET https://lms2backend.whencefinancesystem.com/cash-health/province/{province}?cycle_start=...` — note this uses a **60s timeout** (the API call) and a **15s timeout** for the actual HTTP request (line 467).
7. Aborts with API status on failure.
8. Returns view `cash-health.province` with:
    - `$provinceHealth` — API response (includes `province_name`, `province_id`, `scores`, `financials`, `reason`, `districts[]`)
    - `$cycleStart`, `$cycleEnd`, `$availableCycles`, `$offices`

**Notable difference**: Unlike `show()` and `district()`, this method does **not** wrap the API call in a try-catch. If the API throws an exception, it will propagate as a 500 error.

---

### 2.7 `national(Request $request)` — National Cash Health

**Route**: `GET /cash_health/national` → `cash_health.national`

**Purpose**: Top-level dashboard showing the institution's overall cash health across all provinces, districts, and offices.

**Flow**:
1. Gets all offices: `Office::get()->keyBy('id')`.
2. Calculates current cash cycle (25th-based).
3. Reads/selects `cycle_start` from query params.
4. Validates date format and 25th-day rule.
5. Calculates cycle end.
6. Calls external API: `GET https://lms2backend.whencefinancesystem.com/cash-health/national?cycle_start=...`
7. Calls a **second external API** for institution cash balance:
   - `GET https://withinheremobileapi.com/api/v1/business-dashboard/company/CMP-35230338/summary`
   - Uses `Http::withHeaders(['x-user-email' => 'chikwetihenry@gmail.com'])`
   - Extracts `data.summary.total_balance` → `$totalBalance`
8. Adds `$nationalHealth['provinces'] = $nationalHealth['provinces'] ?? []` (defaults to empty array).
9. Generates 12 available cycles.
10. Returns view `cash-health.national` with:
    - `$nationalHealth` — API response (includes `scores`, `financials`, `reason`, `office_count`, `provinces[]`)
    - `$cycleStart`, `$cycleEnd`, `$availableCycles`, `$offices`, `$totalBalance`

**Additional API call**: The `totalBalance` is fetched from a completely separate external service (WithinHere Mobile API) using a hardcoded company ID and email header.

---

### 2.8 `nationalBalances()` — AJAX Office List

**Route**: `GET /cash_health/national/balances` → `cash_health.national.balances`

**Purpose**: Returns JSON list of all offices with their IDs and wallet IDs for the national cash balance loader.

**Flow**:
1. Queries `Office::select('id', 'name', 'province_id', 'district_id', 'withinhere_wallet_id')->get()`.
2. Maps each office to a simplified array.
3. Returns JSON: `{success: true, offices: [...]}`

**Note**: `withinhere_wallet_id` is **not** in the Office model's `$fillable` array, so it must be set directly in the database or via a raw query elsewhere.

---

### 2.9 `nationalOfficeBalance($officeId)` — AJAX Single Office Balance

**Route**: `GET /cash_health/national/balance/{officeId}` → `cash_health.national.office.balance`

**Purpose**: Fetches cash balance for a single office from the WithinHere backend.

**Flow**:
1. Finds office by ID.
2. Returns 404 if not found.
3. Returns `{success: false, message: 'Please verify withinhere wallet'}` if `withinhere_wallet_id` is missing.
4. Calls external API: `POST https://withinheremobileapi.com/api/v1/lmsuser/branch_ledger`
   - Headers: none explicitly set (relies on default)
   - Body: `{wallet_id, start_date: '2026-01-01', end_date: today}`
   - Timeout: 180s, connect timeout: 30s, **2 retries** with 100ms delay
5. On success: extracts `data.user.cash_balance`.
6. Returns JSON: `{success: true, office_id, province_id, district_id, balance}`

---

## 3. Routes

All routes are in `routes/web.php` (lines 248–289), grouped under `prefix => 'cash_health'`:

| Method | URI | Controller Method | Route Name |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/cash_health/show/{id}` | `show` | `cash_health.show` |
| GET | `/cash_health/district/{district}` | `district` | `cash_health.district` |
| GET | `/cash_health/province/{province}` | `province` | `cash_health.province` |
| GET | `/cash_health/national` | `national` | `cash_health.national` |
| GET | `/cash_health/contribution/{id}` | `contributionHistory` | `cash_health.contribution` |
| GET | `/cash_health/national/balances` | `nationalBalances` | `cash_health.national.balances` |
| GET | `/cash_health/national/balance/{officeId}` | `nationalOfficeBalance` | `cash_health.national.office.balance` |

**Note**: There is an additional route at line 1624:
```php
Route::get('/hello/{office}', [CashHealthController::class, 'show'])
    ->name('cash-health.show');
```
This is a legacy/alternate route using the same controller method.

## 7. Office Model Relationship

The `Office` model (`app/Models/Office.php`) is used extensively:

- **Table**: `offices`
- **Key relationships**:
  - `province()` → `Province` (hasOne)
  - `district()` → `District` (hasOne)
  - `districtRegional()` → `DistrictRegional` (hasOne)
  - `manager()` → `User` (belongsTo)
- **Fields used by CashHealthController**:
  - `id`, `name` — for office identification
  - `province_id`, `district_id` — for hierarchical grouping
  - `withinhere_wallet_id` — for cash balance API calls (not in `$fillable`)
